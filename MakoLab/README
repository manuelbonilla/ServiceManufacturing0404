PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    The MakoLab toolbox is a MATLAB interface for CRISIS.  Currently the 
    toolbox is setup only for the Windows Matlab environment. For 
    information regarding commands and functions supported by this toolbox
    type in 

        >> help MakoLab

    If developing or contributing to this Toolbox please refer to the 
    DIRECTORY STRUCTURE below for information on where files need to be 
    located.

    Additional information and template m files are in available
    in MAKO Twiki under MakoLab.
    
    For installation instructions please refer to the INSTALL file.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
    
    TopLevelFolder
        |    The toplevel folder will contain all the scripts and
        |    functions that are available via the toolbox.  These
        |    functions will be the interface to be used by 
        |    developers for Service and Manfuacturing scripts and
        |    commonly used functions (e.g. homing, resetRobot etc)
        |
        |----> development
        |        This folder is for R&D type functions and
        |        scripts.  These scripts MUST NOT be called
        |        by any scripts in the TopLevelFolder or in 
        |        any of the service and manufacturing scripts
        |        These scripts are to be considered temporary
        |        and will not be installed in productions 
        |        environments.  This is the place to checkin
        |        test scripts and experimental scripts.
        |        If a script requires additional files 
        |        (e.g. rom files or stl files) create a subdir
        |        with the script name.  DONOT use files from 
        |        other script folders.  Scripts in this folder
        |        must be as "standalone" as possible.
        |
        |----> extern
        |        Installation files or dependencies 
        |        (e.g. specific compilers or libraries required
        |        by the toolbox).
        |
        |----> mex
        |        C-Mex files used by the toolbox
        |
        |----> @control_object
        |        CRISIS control module object methods 
        |
        |----> @hgs_robot
        |        Robot object methods
        |
        |----> @ndi_camera
                 NDI Polaris Camera object methods
