INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
    This package is supported only in the Windows environment.

    PRE-REQUISITES
        OS and SOFTWARE VERSION
            This toolbox is supported only under Windows
            Matlab version used is MATLAB R2006b or later

        COMPILER and MEX SETUP
            This set is required only once.  If mex has already 
            been setup on your system, please ignore this section.
            To check your mex compiler setup use the
            >> mex -v
	    
	    Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Compiler:
	    	This is the recommended compiler for Makolab

		Download and install the following packages
	    	
		* Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express edition
			http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP	

		* Microsoft Windows SDK
			http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx

            Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 compiler:

                Follow the instructions for installing and setting up
                Microsoft VC Express for use with mex, included in the 
                "MSVCExpress install instructions.pdf" in the extern 
                folder of MakoLab or can be found at the following location.
                /MakoLab/extern/MSVCExpress%20install%20insturctions.pdf?rev=HEAD&content-type=application/pdf

                An iso of the required CD is also available on
                the MakoLab twiki page.  The pdf is available 
                
                NOTE: Make sure you have the MSSDK environment variable set 
                correctly (as per the pdf above).  You can set the environment
                variable by right clicking on "My Computer", "properties" and 
                selecting "Environment variables" under the "Advanced Tab". 


                NOTE: Note the full SDK install is not necessary.  The 
                appendix in the pdf file shows a much smaller and quicker
                install.

                mex setup for makolab should now be complete.

                NOTE: a nice example for using the MVS debugger can be found
                at 
                http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_external/f32489.html
                
        >> mex -setup

                when prompted to select installer choose BCC.
                and confirm by pressing 'Y'
                
        mex setup for makolab should now be complete.

    FOR LINUX COMPUTERS
        GCC compiler:
        Installation of the GCC is beyond the scope of this document.  
        Check if you already have a version of GCC installed
        This can be done by typing the following on any xterm
        
        >> gcc --version

        Matlab documentation states that GCC version 4.1 and greater is 
        supported by Matlab 2007.  During the creation of this document 
        ther version of gcc installed was 4.1.2

        Once gcc installation is verified start matlab in linux
        run the mex setup in matlab by typing

        >> mex -setup

        Select Y to locate all compilers installed on your machine and then 
        select gcc from the list of compilers.  Select Y if prompted to create
        or overwrite the mexopts.sh file

        Now open the mexopts.sh file by typing the following in Matlab

        >> open (fullfile(prefdir,'mexopts.sh'))

        This should open a matlab editor with the mexopts file.  Now find and 
        remove every instance of the word "-ansi" (without the quotes shown)

        Save and exit.

        mex setup for makolab should now be complete.


    INSTALLATION
        Check out the MakoLab onto your computer.  Refer to CVS setup
        documentation for your CVS client on how to obtain this.

        Add the MakoLab and its subdirectories into the Matlab path
        This can be done by typing

        >> addpath(genpath(MAKO_LAB_DIR))
        OR
        >> pathtool
        
        Where MAKO_LAB_DIR is the base directory where the MakoLab 
        toolbox was downloaded.  pathtool will provide a GUI which can
        be used to select the directories to be added.  The following 
        directories must be selected.
            * MakoLab
            * MakoLab/mex

        Once the path is setup type in
        >> makemex

        This should compile all the required mex files.

        At this point installation is complete.  
     
     IMPORTANT NOTE
        Please make sure that the firewall permits response to ping.  
        Once connected to the server the server will send pings to 
        check host status at regular intervals if there is no activity.

        type
        >> help MakoLab 
        for documentation and supported functions.

        makolabdemo.m shows a simple example utilizing the
        MakoLab.

Added link to the pdf to install VC++ for people who do not want to
download Makolab before starting the install process

Revision 1.8  2008/04/17 14:17:04  dmoses
Updated makemex to automatically detect the correct
directories and paths.  This will allow compilation from any directory
as long as makemex is in the path.  Also updated the install instructions
to reflect this change

Revision 1.7  2008/02/29 05:14:55  dmoses
Added instructions to install Makolab in Linux

Revision 1.6  2008/02/29 03:47:46  dmoses
Updated makemex to automatically adjust parameters depending on compiler
installed.  This will also allow customization when going to linux and using
gcc options in matlab.

Revision 1.5  2008/01/18 17:25:32  dmoses
Added instructions for using Microsoft VC++ compiler for MakoLab
